MIDS W205 Exercise 1 Tom Seddon

Most Variable Procedures
------------------------

Based on the standardized variation in their measures,
I identify pregnancy care and ER wait times as the most
variable procedures between hospitals of my seven measures.

AMI	HF	PN	PREG	IMM	ER	PSI_90		
0.09	0.13	0.134	1.799	0.059	0.586	0.251

Approach
--------

I used the summarized mean and standard deviation scores for each procedure
that I had previously calculated.

Because the procedures have different measurement bases, I normalized the
standard deviations by dividing each by the mean score for its measure.

This gives a similar basis of comparison across measures to assess how
large the variability is to the typical score for that measure.

We can see above that the two largest scores are for the % of women who
have delivery scheduled early incorrectly (the PREG column) and the median
number of minutes patients wait before seeing a doctor in the ER (the ER)
column.
