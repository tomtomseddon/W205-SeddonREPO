MIDS W205 Exercise 1 Tom Seddon

Best Hospitals
--------------

I identify ten states that are models of high quality care:

State	Score	Hospitals
OH      1.79    80                                                              
IN	1.51	55
VA	1.35	52
FL	1.32	102
CO	1.24	29
MA	1.21	40
TX	1.15	154
MO	1.1	49
KS	0.83	20
MN	0.62	26


Approach
--------

I used the normalized, weighted overall rating score that I'd previously calculated by hospital
to create an average score for the hospitals in each state.

I noticed that many of the extreme scores at the top and bottom of the table were coming
from states with small numbers of hospitals, which is as expected given the smoothing effect
of larger samples.

I decided to set a minimum of 20 hospitals in a state to be able to compare it as as model
of high quality care, and filtered the results accordingly, as shown above.
