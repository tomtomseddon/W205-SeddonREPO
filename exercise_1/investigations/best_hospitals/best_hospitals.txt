MIDS W205 Exercise 1 Tom Seddon

Best Hospitals
--------------

I identify ten hospitals that are a model of high quality care:

Average score for the 1936 hospitals with                14.1   12.0  16.4  2     96   29   0.578
good data across all 7 procedures


Approach
--------

1) Identified measures to represent 'procedures'

I researched the existing 'Hospital Value Based Purchasing' measures used by Medicare.
This suggested to me that a combination of outcome, process and safety measures would be
appropriate to represent different types of 'procedures'.

I then reviewed what proportion of hospitals had data for some of the main candidate
procedures, as a lot of measures have only scant reporting, and some procedures are only
done in a subset of hospitals.  For this exercise I decided it was more important to cast
the net widely to include as many candidate hospitals as possible.

I picked seven different measures to give a reasonable spread of types of procedures

Outcomes
AMI  - mortality rate (in 30 days) from Acute Myocardial Infarction
HF   - mortality rate (in 30 days) from Heart Failure
PN   - mortality rate (in 30 days) from Heart Failure

Processes
PREG   - % of mothers whose deliveries were scheduled too early unnecessarily
IMM    - % of patients assessed and given flu vaccine
ER     - median minutes spent in the ER before being seen by a physician

Safety
PSI_90 - aggregated measure of post surgical complication rate


2) Screening out hospitals without valid measures on all

I decided that because the goal was to identify hospitals who performed well across a 
number of measures, I would screen out those which didn't have valid information across
all seven.  This allows for a clean comparison among this group and I determined that
1936 hospitals met this criteria, so felt that I still had enough hospitals to work with
after the screening.


3) Normalizing the measures

Each of these measures has a different base rate and variability.  I decided to deal with
this by normalizing the measures (in the statistical, rather than the database sense).

For each measure, I calculated the mean and standard deviation of the score across the
1936 observations.  I then took each hospital's score and calculated the difference from
the mean, and divided that difference by the standard deviation.

I calculated the difference to make a positive z-score be 'good' (which means lower than
the mean for all scores except IMM, where higher that the mean is better).


4) Creating a total score

I decided that I wanted to weight the impact of outcomes, processes and safety evenly in
my final scoring of hospitals.  Since I have three outcome and three process measures I 
did this by calculating an Overall score that included a weighting factor of 3 for the 
safety score, to achieve that.

I then sorted the hospitals in descending order of overall rating as above.

I included the raw scores for each of the measures, and a comparison to the overall mean
scores for each of those measures, to show how each of these ten hospitals are better on
almost all procedures, therefore I think the evidence supports that they represent models
of high quality care.
