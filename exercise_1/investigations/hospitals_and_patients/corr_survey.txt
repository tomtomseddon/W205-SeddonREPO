Link between Patient survey rating and other measures
-----------------------------------------------------

A.  Patient Survey rating vs Medicare overall VBP rating

There does appear to be a general link between the survey scores
reported by patients and the overall rating for the hospital 
from the Medicare VBP rating (overall 1-5 rating).

This can be seen in the table below which groups the hospitals
by VBP rating and shows the corresponding average patient survey
score for that group.  The Patient survey scores increase as the 
VBP rating improves.

VBP	Patient Hospital
rating	Survey	Count
5       81.36   79                                                              
4	75.09	706
3	70.08	1320
2	64.8	635
1	59.69	105

Note:  Since patient survey is one component of the VBP rating
some link between them is to be expected.

B. Patient Survey rating vs Measure of Consistency

There also seems to be a general tendency for hospitals with
higher patient survey scores to perform better on the measure of
consistent performance across seven different procedures that I 
created.

This can be seen in the table below which groups the hospitals
by their patient survey rating group, and shows the average
score on my total standardized achievement score.  Counts of 
hospitals in each group are also shown.

Patient
Survey		Standardized    Hospital
Rating Group	Achievement	Count
9 out of 10     1.27   		14                                                      
8 out of 10	2.31		29
7 out of 10	1.51		59
6 out of 10	1.08		76
5 out of 10	1		120
4 out of 10	0.09		141
3 out of 10	0.68		159
2 out of 10	0.36		203
1 out of 10	-0.16		171
0 out of 10	-0.59		953

There is a general pattern that hospitals rated higher by patients
have higher achievement on my standardized score.  It should be noted
that I suppressed the Rating Group for "10 out of 10" as there were
only 7 hospitals in it, making it less reliable, and I needed to limit
the output to 10 rows, as per the instructions.
